## Introduction 

Apple Inc. is one of the leading tech companies in the world. Headquartered in Cupertino, the company specializes in personal digital devices such as the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and others. Apple products have become an integral part of our daily lives. If it's not an iPhone, perhaps you're using a MacBook or an iPad. Even if you don't use these products yourself, chances are you have a friend who does. It's no surprise, then, the level of attention the company garners during product releases and conferences. At their WWDC in 2024, Apple received significant attention from various social media sources. It is against this backdrop that I decided to perform sentiment analysis based on the Twitter audience.
